Disclaimer

    This software is still in very early stages of development, so don't expect
    much. It's also unstable, and experimental, and might trash your system
    and/or data. Use at your own risk.

    Other than that, you should have some understanding of programming with
    GStreamer at the application level, or at least how to use the
    command-line tools such as gst-launch, or at the very very least you
    should understand the difference between an element, a pad, and a pad
    template, and have some idea of how to connect them together. The more you
    know about GStreamer, the more sense this application will make. 

    This is a low-level visualization tool, not a high-level synthesizer/video
    effect processor. If that's what you want, it's already been done. Go
    check out PureData or the various GUIs that exist for csound. While it is
    in theory possible to construct such things with this application, doing
    so is likely to be painful and not very functional. One day, perhaps.

Installing:

    * run chmod +x gst-editor
    * there is currently no installation proceedure

Running:

    run ./gst-editor from this directory

Manual

    This application allows you to construct gstreamer pipeliens in an interactive
    manner. 

    The editor window is divided into several parts:

    To add elements to the pipeline you simply drag them from the element browser
    and onto the pipeline editor.

    *HINT* You can add files more easily by choosing "add filesrc" from the
    toolbar, or by dragging and dropping files from nautilus, etc. Note that
    just becuause they appear in the pipeline editor doesn't mean they're
    going to work with gstreamer. GSTEditor assumes nothing about the files
    you add.

    You can link elements together by connecting their pads together. To remove
    objects, whether they be links or elements, you select them and choose
    "Delete" from the tool bar.

    When you are satisfied with your pipelien and want to test it, press play. If
    the pipeline is able to play, this will happen right away. If not, you'll see
    the pipeline stuck in either the "Paused" or "Ready" state. Examine the
    console output to determine why the pipeline is not playing, and try again.

    The pipeline can be stoped by pressing the "Null" button.

    Elements have propertys which can be changed at any time. Selecting an element
    will make its properties available in the Property Editor. You simply change
    them as you see fit, the changes will take effect immediately.

What Works

    * Adding and removing elements from the timeline, 
    * linking arbitrary pads.
    * selection
    * deletion

What Doesn't

    * Property Editor
    * No support for saving or loading pipelines
    * Undo/Redo haven't been implemented
    * linking pad templates
    * no way to view or manipulate pad caps
